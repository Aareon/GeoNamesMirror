Automated mirror of GeoNames geographical database, updated weekly.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as an automated mirror for the GeoNames `allCountries.zip` dataset. It provides a reliable, versioned source for GeoNames postal code data, updated on a weekly basis.

## 🔄 Update Schedule

The GeoNames data is checked for updates every Sunday at 00:00 UTC. If new data is available, this repository will automatically create a new release with the updated `allCountries.zip` file.

## 📦 Accessing the Data

You can access the latest GeoNames data in two ways:

1. **Latest Release**: Always points to the most recent data.
   - URL: `https://github.com/Aareon/GeoNamesMirror/releases/latest/download/allCountries.zip`

2. **Specific Version**: Access a specific version of the data by its release tag.
   - URL: `https://github.com/Aareon/GeoNamesMirror/releases/download/release-{number}/allCountries.zip`
   - Replace `{number}` with the specific release number you want to access.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### update_allCountries.py

This Python script is responsible for:
- Checking if a new version of the GeoNames data is available
- Downloading the new data if an update is found
- Preparing the data for release

Key features:
- Uses `httpx` for asynchronous HTTP requests
- Implements robust error handling and logging
- Verifies data integrity after download

### update_allCountries.yml

This GitHub Actions workflow:
- Runs on a weekly schedule (every Sunday at 00:00 UTC)
- Can also be triggered manually
- Executes the `update_allCountries.py` script
- Creates a new release with the updated data if changes are detected

## 📊 Data Statistics

Each release includes basic statistics about the data:
- Total number of entries
- Number of countries covered
- File size
- MD5 checksum of the zip file
